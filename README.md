# Summary

Dataset generator of strain (time series) samples containing phenomenological gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae added to noise from LIGO-Virgo interferometric detectors. Jupyter notebooks developed in Python and written by Manuel D. Morales (e-mail: <manueld.morales@academicos.udg.mx>).


# Technical details

<b><ins>Interferometric noise</ins></b>

For this implementation, we used real noise from LIGO (L1, H1) and Virgo (V1) interferometric detectors from O3b run. This is a non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise stored in strain time series of 4,096s of duration, sampled at 16384 Hz and 4096 Hz. For our implementation, we choose the second sampling option. Data available on the [Gravitational Wave Open Science Center](https://gwosc.org/).

<b><ins>Phenomenological waveforms</ins></b>

We draw on CCSN phenomenological waveforms. These were generated by the [SignalGenerator_Phen](https://github.com/CesarTiznado/SignalGenerator_Phen) code, following the model first proposed by [Astone et al Phys. Rev. D 98, 122002 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.122002). This simplified stochastic non-physical model mimics one of the features common in GW signals obtained from all multi-dimensional general relativistic CCSN simulations, namely the high-frequency feature (HFF). In the time-frequency representation (such as that provided by spectrograms and scalograms), the HFF has an increasing monotonically frequency profile in time, which, at first order, can be considered linear. We draw on three sets of phenomenological waveforms:

- 200 waveforms with 1,620 =< HFF slope =< 4,990 (class 1)
- 200 waveforms with 1,450 =< HFF slope < 1,620 (class 2)
- 200 waveforms with 950 =< HFF slope < 1,450 (class 3)

# Implementation structure

Run the codes in the following order:

`Noise_Explorer.ipynb` for downloading interferometric noise data from LIGO and Virgo detectors (segments of 4,096 s), exploring time series and power spectral densities, and locally saving noise segments. Open data was obtained from the website of the GWOSC.

`WaveformPhen_Explorer.ipynb` for analyzing three representative waveforms; exploring their morphologies in the time domain and the time-frequency domain. Spectrograms (applying short-time Fourier transform) and scalograms (applying Morlet wavelet transform) are plotted.

`Prepare_Waveforms.ipynb` for resampling and rescaling all phenomenological waveforms, resulting in dimensionless strain time series with a sampling frequency of 4,094Hz. Modified waveforms are saved as dictionaries, separated by class.

`Process_PhenWaveforms.ipynb` for applying injection procedure, data conditioning (whitened, band-pass filtering), and generating a dataset of window strain samples containing interferometric noise plus phenomenological waveforms. These windows have a time length of Twin, and are saved in .txt files each one. In addition, a log.dat file is saved which contains information about injected signals in windows.
