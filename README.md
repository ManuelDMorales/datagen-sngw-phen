# Summary

Dataset generator of strain (time series) samples containing phenomenological gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae added to noise from LIGO-Virgo interferometric detectors. Interactive Jupyter notebooks developed in Python and written by Manuel D. Morales (e-mail: <manueld.morales@academicos.udg.mx>).


# Technical details

<b><ins>Interferometric noise</ins></b>

For this implementation, we used real noise from LIGO (L1, H1) and Virgo (V1) interferometric detectors from O3b run. This is a non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise stored in strain time series of 16384 Hz and 4096 Hz; we choose the second sampling option. All data is open, and is available on the [Gravitational Wave Open Science Center](https://gwosc.org/).

<b><ins>Phenomenological waveforms</ins></b>

We draw on CCSN phenomenological waveforms. These were generated by the [SignalGenerator_Phen](https://github.com/CesarTiznado/SignalGenerator_Phen) code, following the model first proposed by Astone et al Phys. Rev. D 98, 122002 (2018). This is a simplified stochastic non-physical model that mimics one of the features that is common in GW signals obtained from all multi-dimensional general relativistic CCSN simulations, namely the high-frequency feature (HFF). In the time-frequency representation (such as that provided by spectrograms and scalograms), the HFF has an increasing monotonically frequency profile in time, which, at first order, can be considered linear. We draw on three subsets of phenomenological waveforms, depending on their HFF slope:

- <b>Class 1</b>: $1,620 \lt \text{Slope}_{HFF} \lt 4,990$
- <b>Class 2</b>: $1,450 \lt \text{Slope}_{HFF} \lt 1,620$
- <b>Class 3</b>: $950 \lt \text{Slope}_{HFF} \lt 1,450$
